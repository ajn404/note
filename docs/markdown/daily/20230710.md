### 继续typescript

#### chaptor 4 Object

“Most TypeScript projects prefer using the interface keyword to describe object types”

#### structural typing

“Structural typing not the same as duck typing, which comes from the phrase “If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it’s probably a duck.”

```ts
type WithFirstName = {
  firstName: string;
};

type WithLastName = {
  lastName: string;
};

const hasBoth = {
  firstName: "Lucille",
  lastName: "Clifton",
};

// Ok: `hasBoth` contains a `firstName` property of type `string`
let withFirstName: WithFirstName = hasBoth;

// Ok: `hasBoth` contains a `lastName` property of type `string`
let withLastName: WithLastName = hasBoth;”
```


##### excess property checking


```ts
type Poet = {
    born: number;
    name: string;
}

// Ok: all fields match what's expected in Poet
const poetMatch: Poet = {
  born: 1928,
  name: "Maya Angelou"
};

const extraProperty: Poet = {
    activity: "walking",
    born: 1935,
    name: "Mary Oliver",
};
```
